This is full stack MERN application. App is like social-media where users can upload posts and others people can see them and like them. Also app have full 
authentication, users can create account and login with that account. Also I have used Google OAuth so the user is allow to login through their Google accounts.
To build this application I have used next technologies:
  * Front End  [link](https://github.com/HristijanGjorgjioski/Memories-Frontend)
    - React
      - Redux
        - redux-thunk
      - Hooks
    - Axios(for fetching and sending data to backend)
    - React-Google-Login(for Google Auth)
    - React-File-Base64(for photo upload)
    - React-Router-Dom(for routing)
    - Moment(to show time on the posts)
    - jwt-decode(json web token for auth)
  
  * Back End  [link](https://github.com/HristijanGjorgjioski/Memories-Backend)
    - NodeJS
      - nodemon
    - Express
    - Cors
    - jsonwebtoken(for authentication)
    - body-parser(for data parsing)
    - bcryptjs(for password hashing)
    - MongoDB(database)
      - mongoose
      
      
## Important
  When you use the app please be patinet. Posts may be loading slower beacuse I use free sites for deployment, and therefore the requests are slower.
